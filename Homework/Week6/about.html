            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Charles Werk and I am a computer science student passionate about technology and
                innovation. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's and will be done this Spring. I have a strong
                foundation in
                programming languages such as Python and Java and am proficient in website design.</p>
            <p>I am particularly interested in Software Engineering and Application Development. I have experience
                working on group software projects including website design, mobile app development, and many
                programming assignments.
                I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in video game development and creative coding!</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a quick learner, a team player, and have excellent
                problem-solving abilities. I am always eager to take on new challenges and am excited about the
                opportunities that lie ahead in my career in computer science.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
