# Final Project: Defenders of the Realm: A p5.js Tower Defense Game

## Project Description

In "Defenders of the Realm," players will construct a variety of defensive towers along a path to prevent waves of enemies from reaching their base. The game will feature an interactive interface created with p5.js, allowing players to choose from different tower types and strategically place them on the game map. As players progress, they can upgrade towers, enhancing their range, damage, and special abilities.

## Inspiration and Related Work

**Inspiration:**

- **Plants vs Zombies**: This game is a primary inspiration due to its accessible gameplay and strategic depth. Its approach to balancing various tower types and enemy waves offers valuable lessons in game design.
- **Kingdom Rush**: Known for its detailed graphics and complex level design, this game demonstrates effective implementation of a leveling system within a tower defense context.

**Related Work:**

- Online tutorials on basic p5.js game mechanics have provided a foundation in handling animations and interactive elements, essential for developing a game like this.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Key Challenges:**

- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implementing an efficient pathfinding algorithm will be crucial. I plan to use the A\* algorithm, which will require studying its theory and application in JavaScript.
- **Game Balancing**: Ensuring that the game is challenging yet fair will involve iterative testing and adjustment of gameplay variables, such as tower cost and enemy speed.
- **Learning New Technologies**: As this is my first large project using p5.js for a game of this complexity, I expect a steep learning curve.

**Proposed Solutions:**

- I will access online resources and communities for learning about the A\* algorithm and its implementation in JavaScript.

## Work Plan

**Detailed Timeline:**

- **Week 1**: Setup basic game environment and player input handling.
- **Week 2**: Implement basic enemy types and simple pathfinding.
- **Week 2**: Develop tower placement and firing mechanics.
- **Week 3**: Introduce tower upgrades and advanced enemy waves.
- **Week 3**: Final testing, debugging, and deployment.

## Progress This Week

This week, I have:

- Researched p5.js capabilities and limitations.
- Created the initial project setup with basic game loop and rendering.
- Explored similar tower defense games for additional insights.

## Conclusion

I am excited to apply my skills in JavaScript and p5.js to develop "Defenders of the Realm." This project will not only challenge my coding skills but also enhance my understanding of game design and project management. I look forward to presenting a functioning tower defense game that is both fun and engaging.
